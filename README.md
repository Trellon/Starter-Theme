# Instructions for Getting Started

There are a number of ways to get started with this theme.

## Overview

You have to set up your theme in order to get started.

1. Install components with bower

2. Install components with npm

## Quickstart

    bower install
    npm install --save-dev

# Included components

Gruntfile.js includes a number of components to make theming easier.

_From Grunt_

1. grunt-sass: libsass, for lightning fast SASS compilation.
2. grunt-contrib-watch: livereload support for viewing changes in your browser without refreshing the page.
3. grunt-kss: creates KSS styleguides.
4. grunt-contrib-copy: for coppying files around in your theme.

_From Bower_

1. Sassy-Buttons: for fancy buttons.
2. compass-mixins: a replacement for Compass that works with libsass.
3. compass-breakpoint: a media query mixin that sometimes works with libsass (we usually find another way).
4. zen-grids: This is Zen Grids 2, used in place of the version that comes with zen.
